## Post-Demo Q&A

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: How real-time is the data?**
> A: 500-millisecond polling interval from devices, with SignalR WebSocket updates pushing to the dashboard in real-time. Full round-trip is typically < 1 second from device to clinical alert.

**Q: What if the MQTT broker goes down?**
> A: The Edge Gateway has offline buffering - it stores messages locally and replays them once the broker comes back online. No data loss.

**Q: Can it integrate with our EHR?**
> A: Yes - all data is FHIR R4 compliant. The Bulk Data API endpoint allows export to any FHIR-compatible system. We also support HL7 v2 translators.

**Q: What about security?**
> A: All components support TLS 1.2+. Authentication can use OAuth 2.0 or SMART on FHIR. Audit logging captures all clinical data modifications.

**Q: How many devices can it scale to?**
> A: Docker Compose is for demo/small deployments. On Kubernetes with load balancing, we can scale to hundreds of devices per cluster, thousands globally with multi-region deployment.

**Q: What's the infrastructure cost?**
> A: Demo runs on 4GB RAM. Production typically needs 8-16GB. Cloud deployment on AKS/EKS: ~$200-500/month for modest load.
